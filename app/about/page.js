					ABOUT US
				</div>

				<p className=" font-semibold ">
					Welcome to the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering
					at Vignanâ€™s Institute of Information Technology (A), Visakhapatnam!
					<br />
					Our team, consisting of Batch B9 students under the guidance of Mr. K.
					Chaitanya, Assistant Professor, embarked on an innovative project
					aimed at revolutionizing urban lighting infrastructure. Our project,
					titled "Smart Fault Detection and Maintenance for IoT-Based Street
					Lighting Systems," addresses the challenges faced by traditional
					street lighting systems by integrating cutting-edge Internet of Things
					(IoT) technology.
				</p>

				<h2 className="text-y-dark font-semibold text-2xl">Introduction</h2>
				<p className=" font-semibold ">
					In modern cities, street lighting is crucial for safety and energy
					efficiency. However, traditional systems often face issues like
					delayed maintenance and wasted resources due to undetected faults. Our
					project focuses on using IoT technology to solve these problems. By
					installing sensors on streetlights and analyzing data in real-time, we
					can quickly detect issues like broken bulbs or power problems. This
					means maintenance teams can be alerted right away, leading to faster
					repairs and less downtime. Plus, by predicting when maintenance is
					needed, we can save money and make the system more reliable. In short,
					our Smart Fault Detection system makes street lighting smarter, safer,
					and more efficient for everyone.
				</p>

				<h2 className="text-y-dark font-semibold text-2xl">Objectives</h2>
				<p className=" font-semibold ">Our primary objectives include:</p>
				<ul className=" font-semibold list-disc list-inside">
					<li className=" font-semibold ">
						Development of an IoT-integrated sensor network implementation.
					</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">
						Integration of automated maintenance procedures and protocols.
					</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">
						Establishment of a web-based management system.
					</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">
						Optimization of energy consumption and sustainability.
					</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">Fault detection and localization.</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">Predictive maintenance.</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">Remote monitoring and control.</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">
						Ensuring communication reliability.
					</li>
					<li className=" font-semibold ">
						Ensuring data security, privacy, and cost optimization.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 className="text-y-dark font-semibold text-2xl">Approach</h2>
				<p className=" font-semibold ">
					We utilize a combination of advanced sensors, including MQ-2, MQ-4,
					MQ-6, MQ-9, and DHT-11, integrated with ESP32 microcontroller, to
					monitor various parameters such as gas concentrations, temperature,
					and humidity. By processing data in real-time, our system can detect
					deviations from normal operating conditions and trigger alerts for
					proactive fault identification.
				</p>
